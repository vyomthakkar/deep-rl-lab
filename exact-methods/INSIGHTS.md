# RL Algorithm Optimization Insights

This document summarizes the theoretical improvements made to Value Iteration (VI) and Policy Iteration (PI) implementations based on expert feedback and RL best practices.

## Problem Statement

Initial implementations suffered from several issues that made algorithmic comparisons unfair:
- Non-γ-scaled stopping criteria made VI appear artificially fast at high discount factors
- Poor initialization strategies for PI
- Inconsistent computational cost accounting between algorithms
- Tie-breaking rules that caused unnecessary policy oscillation

## Optimization Improvements

### 1. Value Iteration (VI) Enhancements

#### Gamma-Scaled Stopping Criterion
**Theoretical Foundation:** ε-optimality guarantee
- **Before:** `delta < tol` (naive stopping)
- **After:** `delta < tol * (1 - γ) / 2` (theoretically sound)
- **Guarantee:** When algorithm stops, ||V* - V||∞ ≤ ε

**Impact:**
- High γ: Requires more iterations (correct behavior)
- Low γ: Requires fewer iterations
- Fair comparison across different discount factors

#### Consistent Backup Counting
- **Before:** Cumulative backups `(i + 1) * S * A`
- **After:** Per-iteration backups `S * A`
- **Benefit:** Hardware-independent algorithmic comparison

### 2. Policy Iteration (PI) Enhancements

#### Smart Initialization Strategy
**Motivation:** Poor initialization forces unnecessary policy improvement steps
- **Before:** `pi = zeros(S)` (all actions = "Up")
- **After:** `pi = R.argmax(axis=1)` (greedy w.r.t. immediate rewards)
- **Impact:** Significant reduction in outer iterations

#### Howard's Improvement Tie-Breaking
**Theoretical Foundation:** Prefer current action when Q-values are tied
- **Before:** `Q.argmax(axis=1)` (aggressive switching)
- **After:** Keep current action when `|Q[s,a] - Q[s,π(s)]| < ε`
- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  pi_next = np.where(Q.max(axis=1) - Q[np.arange(S), pi] < 1e-12, 
                     pi, Q.argmax(axis=1))
  ```
- **Benefit:** Prevents policy oscillation, faster convergence

#### PI-Specific Cost Accounting
**Recognition:** PI has different computational structure than VI
- **Evaluation Cost:** `inner_iterations * S` state evaluations
- **Improvement Cost:** `S * A` Q-value computations
- **Total:** `inner_iter * S + S * A` per outer iteration
- **Benefit:** Accurate cost comparison with VI

### 3. Feature Flag Architecture

#### Design Philosophy
Enable A/B testing between naive and optimized implementations:
```python
def run_vi(mdp, tol, max_iters, logger, use_optimizations=False)
def run_pi(mdp, eval_tol, max_eval_iters, logger, use_optimizations=False)
```

#### Benefits
- **Educational:** Compare optimization impact
- **Research:** Validate theoretical improvements
- **Debugging:** Isolate specific optimizations
- **Compatibility:** Preserve original behavior by default

## Experimental Impact

### Expected Results with Optimizations

| Scenario | VI Behavior | PI Behavior |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| High γ (0.99) | More iterations (theoretically correct) | Fewer iterations (smart init) |
| Low γ (0.9) | Fewer iterations | Significant speedup |
| Deterministic | Proper stopping behavior | No tie oscillation |
| Stochastic | γ-scaled tolerance | Stable convergence |

### Bellman Backup Comparison
Fair algorithmic comparison using hardware-independent metrics:
- **VI Cost per Iteration:** `S × A` backups
- **PI Cost per Outer Iteration:** `inner_sweeps × S + S × A` backups

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Bug Fix
**Shape Broadcasting Error:** Howard's improvement initially used `keepdims=True`:
```python
# WRONG: Creates (S, S) policy instead of (S,)
Q.max(axis=1, keepdims=True) - Q[np.arange(S), pi]

# CORRECT: Maintains (S,) shape
Q.max(axis=1) - Q[np.arange(S), pi]
```

### Validation Practices
Always validate intermediate array shapes:
```python
assert pi_next.shape == (num_states,), f"Policy shape error: {pi_next.shape}"
assert pi_next.dtype == np.int64, f"Policy dtype error: {pi_next.dtype}"
```

## Setting the right temperature and Entropy for Soft Value Iteration:

- It is very important (if you set temperature) to visualize and understand the entropy (average entropy for all states or ideally average entropy for non-terminal states) and how it changes over iterations.
- Also, if you have a deterministic number of states and actions in the environment, you can actually compute the entropy of a uniform/random policy, which is just: S*log(|A|)
- Comparing this theoretical bound of the max entropy of the environment given the set of valid states and actions, with the current entropy give us an indication of how "random/stochastic" the optimal policy is, when compared to the uniform random policy!
- Plotting Temperature vs Policy Entropy allows us to visualize this and choose an appropriate setting of temperature.

### Important Clarifications for above:

1. Which entropy are you averaging?
Be explicit about aggregation and units.

Per-state max (nats): Hmax⁡(s)=ln⁡∣A(s)∣H_{\max}(s)=\ln|A(s)|
Hmax​(s)=ln∣A(s)∣.

If every state has 4 legal actions: Hmax⁡=∑sln⁡4=∣S∣ln⁡4H_{\max}=\sum_s \ln 4 = |S|\ln 4
Hmax​=∑s​ln4=∣S∣ln4 (sum), or ln⁡4\ln 4
ln4 (mean over states).

If using bits, replace ln⁡\ln
ln with log⁡2\log_2
log2​.

If some states are terminal or have fewer legal actions, use ∑sln⁡∣A(s)∣\sum_s \ln |A(s)|
∑s​ln∣A(s)∣ over
non-terminal/valid-action states.

2. State weighting matters
Comparing to ∣S∣log⁡∣A∣|S| \log|A|
∣S∣log∣A∣ assumes an
unweighted sum over all states. Often you care about states visited by the policy:
Havg=∑sdπ(s) H(π(⋅∣s)),Hmax⁡=∑sdπ(s) ln⁡∣A(s)∣.H_{\text{avg}} = \sum_s d_\pi(s)\, H(\pi(\cdot|s)),
\quad
H_{\max} = \sum_s d_\pi(s)\, \ln |A(s)|.Havg​=s∑​dπ​(s)H(π(⋅∣s)),Hmax​=s∑​dπ​(s)ln∣A(s)∣.
Using the on-policy distribution dπd_\pi
dπ​ (or your start-state distribution) makes the comparison reflect behavior the agent actually exhibits.

3. "How random vs uniform?" — use KL, not just entropy
High entropy ≈\approx
≈ near uniform, but
equal entropy ≠ equal distribution. Two policies can share entropy and still be far apart. Add:

KL(π(⋅∣s) ∥ Unif(⋅∣s))\mathrm{KL}\big(\pi(\cdot|s)\,\|\,\text{Unif}(\cdot|s)\big)
KL(π(⋅∣s)∥Unif(⋅∣s)) aggregated over states, and/or

Simple gaps like max⁡aπ(a∣s)\max_a \pi(a|s)
maxa​π(a∣s) (how peaked it is).

These diagnose closeness to uniform more directly than entropy alone.
4. "Optimal" means soft-optimal for that τ
Say explicitly: as τ increases you're optimizing the entropy-regularized objective, not the plain task reward. A policy near the max-entropy bound will behave like uniform; its unregularized return may drop even while the regularized objective improves.
5. τ scales with Q-magnitude
The useful τ depends on the spread δ(s)=max⁡aQ(s,a)−min⁡aQ(s,a)\delta(s)=\max_a Q(s,a)-\min_a Q(s,a)
δ(s)=maxa​Q(s,a)−mina​Q(s,a). What looks like "τ ≥ 0.2 → uniform" in one task may not hold if rewards (hence Q) are rescaled. Consider normalizing or selecting τ based on a target
KL to uniform or a target max-action probability.
6. Handle invalid actions correctly
Ensure you're computing entropy over only legal actions (mask before softmax), otherwise the theoretical bound comparison is off.
